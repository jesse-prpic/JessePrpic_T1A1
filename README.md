- TCP
- HTTP and HTTPS
- web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)

Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet (50 - 150 words for each technology)

## Q4
### Describe the features of "interpreters" and "compilers" and how they are different.

#### Answer
Before understanding what the key differences are between "interpreters" and compilers", we should understand what they are.

These concepts are both language processors and are used to convert codes written in high-level lanuage into machine language codes, this is basically stating that it interprets lanuage understood by humans and is converted into what the machine understand which is 0's and 1's, however these are translated differently - compiler is translated into machine code before the program runs, whilst interpreter translates into machine code line by line as the code runs.

The key differences involved between interpreters and compilers is; firstly the programming languages, where programs languages that use interpreters are JavaScript, Python, Ruby whereas C, C++, Java use compilers.
Another major key difference to consider is that it takes a lesser amount of time to analyze the source code using interpreters, though the overall execution is comparatively slower; this is opposite of a compiler where it it would analyze the source code taking a larger amount of time, however it would be comparatively faster than interpreters (Sassi, 2023).

Another difference to note is the types of Interpreters and Compilers there are; interpreters have 4 common types, whereas compilers have 10.

The reasons why these concepts and processors are important is compilers help catch syntax and semantic errors before we run the code, this inturn saves times and prevents crashes; interpreters on the other hand help clarify misunderstandings, interpret expressions and ensure the correct and intended message is accurately transformed and conveyed.

## Q5
### Identify TWO commonly used programming languages and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each.

#### Answer
In 2022 the latest survey report from Statista highlighted the programming lanugages most preferred by developers. Out of the 700+ lanugages that there are, two of the most common lanuages I will be speaking about today will be;
- JavaScript: at 65.36% preference, this is a high-level, object-oriented programming lanugage built mostly for apps and follows the ECMAScript protocols.
- Python: at 48.07% preference amongst developers, this is a high-level and general purpose programming language which includes structured, functional and object-oriented paradigms.

The benefits and drawbacks of each is as follows;

JavaScript is comparatively fast and smmooth allowing you to render with consistent results across all browsers. Due to the ease of the implementation and learning aspect of JavaScript this has also created a large support community.
Although there are some great benefits with JavaScript, it has drawbacks including; A single error in JavaScript code can stop rendering the entire website, each browser interprets JavaScript differently as well as the code is visibile and accessible to to everyone.

However, although there may be some drawbacks, it still reamins the most popular and demanded programming lanuage with over 40% of recruiters across the globe were seeking to hire.

Python is known to be the best programmming language for any beginners that are starting in the Software Development space, this is because of its simple and easy syntax. Other reasons developers may to choose Python, is due to how it is easily readable and faciliates dynamic coding, however the main benefit when it comes to python is how it follows a step-by-step debugging process - what this means is that the execution stops as soon as an error occurs, not allowing this to pass to the console. Though this is a great benefit, Python may not be able to challenge the developers in a way that will positively impact their skills due to Python being more intuitive than most other lanugages. Those that do use Python experience it being slower than other lanuages like C or C++ and experience testing to be complex and tedious with its Runtime errors.

Similar to JavaScript, Python has its deal of benefits and drawbacks, however it still has a 38% demand amongst recruiters through the top software development companies world wide.

## Q6
### A hypothetical client has sent you an email (shown in the Q6 Email section), asking for you to build them a website. Write an appropriate, professional email response that shows your understanding of the client’s needs for the website, as well as an understanding of appropriate technologies or tools needed to build the website yourself.	

## Hypothetical Client
Hello there

My name is Alex, and I’m the director of the Super Awesome Museum (SAM). We display a variety of interesting artefacts, objects, and paraphernalia about all sorts of things from all over the world.

I’m writing to you because the SAM needs a website. The museum is new in the city, we’re fully funded and don’t sell our items but we just need to encourage people to visit the museum.

We would need a website that showcases some of our interesting exhibits and items, helps people find their way to the museum, and helps people contact the museum.

We don’t know much about this website stuff - does this sound like something that you can do? 

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Alex

Director
