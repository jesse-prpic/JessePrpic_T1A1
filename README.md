## Q2
### Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
- Packets
- IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
- routes and routing
- domains and DNS

Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet.

#### Answer
Packets
A packet is a small chunk of segments (around 1500 bytes) which is from a larger message, these chunks of segments consist of two portions, the header and the payload. Header contains information such as its origin aand destination IP address and the payload refers to the actual data.
Once the payload reaches its destination it will recombine.

An analogy of this I found useful is;
"Suppose Alice is writing a letter to Bob, but Bob's mail slot is only wide enough to accept envelopes the size of a small index card. Instead of writing her letter on normal paper and then trying to stuff it through the mail slot, Alice divides her letter into much shorter sections, each a few words long, and writes these sections out on index cards. She delivers the group of cards to Bob, who puts them in order to read the whole message" (https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/, 2024).

Packet and packet swtiching is a way to allow data to be sent securely, the worlds first computer network was produced in 1969 and is the basis on which the internet still works today.

IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
Internet Protocol or more commonly known as IP addresses is a unique identification number, which is assigned to all computers, however is not created randomly but through math. 
Whether it is through a computer, laptop, tablets, toys etc every device with an internet connection will have this IP address associated to it and there are reasons for this with the most common task is to have the IP to identify the host or a network, or identifying the particular location of the device (A Brief Introduction to the World of IP Addresses | Tripwire, n.d.).

The difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is the age and capability of each, the IPv4 is the older of the two and has space up to 4 billion IP addresses, whereas the IPv6 holds space for trillions - ultimately replacing IPv4. This is due to IPv6 addresses being able to have the capacity of 8 sets of 4 character (32 total, letters and numerals) separated by a colon, meanwhile IPv4 is at most 4 sets of 3 (12 numbers only) separated by a period.

The main purpose of IP addresses is to map the web and send data to the right place, without this the internet would not be able to fulful your data requests - you would not even be able to use social media, check your emails or browse the internet without it (What Is an IP Address and How Does It Work?, n.d.)

If you want to find your IP address, you can simply type "What's my IP" into Google and it will display it amongst the top search results.

## Q3
### Define and features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
- TCP
- HTTP and HTTPS
- web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)

Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet (50 - 150 words for each technology)

## Q4
### Describe the features of "interpreters" and "compilers" and how they are different.

#### Answer
Before understanding what the key differences are between "interpreters" and compilers", we should understand what they are.

These concepts are both language processors and are used to convert codes written in high-level lanuage into machine language codes, this is basically stating that it interprets lanuage understood by humans and is converted into what the machine understand which is 0's and 1's, however these are translated differently - compiler is translated into machine code before the program runs, whilst interpreter translates into machine code line by line as the code runs.

The key differences involved between interpreters and compilers is; firstly the programming languages, where programs languages that use interpreters are JavaScript, Python, Ruby whereas C, C++, Java use compilers.
Another major key difference to consider is that it takes a lesser amount of time to analyze the source code using interpreters, though the overall execution is comparatively slower; this is opposite of a compiler where it it would analyze the source code taking a larger amount of time, however it would be comparatively faster than interpreters (Sassi, 2023).

Another difference to note is the types of Interpreters and Compilers there are; interpreters have 4 common types, whereas compilers have 10.

The reasons why these concepts and processors are important is compilers help catch syntax and semantic errors before we run the code, this inturn saves times and prevents crashes; interpreters on the other hand help clarify misunderstandings, interpret expressions and ensure the correct and intended message is accurately transformed and conveyed.

## Q5
### Identify TWO commonly used programming languages and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each.

#### Answer
In 2022 the latest survey report from Statista highlighted the programming lanugages most preferred by developers. Out of the 700+ lanugages that there are, two of the most common lanuages I will be speaking about today will be;
- JavaScript: at 65.36% preference, this is a high-level, object-oriented programming lanugage built mostly for apps and follows the ECMAScript protocols.
- Python: at 48.07% preference amongst developers, this is a high-level and general purpose programming language which includes structured, functional and object-oriented paradigms.

The benefits and drawbacks of each is as follows;

JavaScript is comparatively fast and smmooth allowing you to render with consistent results across all browsers. Due to the ease of the implementation and learning aspect of JavaScript this has also created a large support community.
Although there are some great benefits with JavaScript, it has drawbacks including; A single error in JavaScript code can stop rendering the entire website, each browser interprets JavaScript differently as well as the code is visibile and accessible to to everyone.

However, although there may be some drawbacks, it still reamins the most popular and demanded programming lanuage with over 40% of recruiters across the globe were seeking to hire.

Python is known to be the best programmming language for any beginners that are starting in the Software Development space, this is because of its simple and easy syntax. Other reasons developers may to choose Python, is due to how it is easily readable and faciliates dynamic coding, however the main benefit when it comes to python is how it follows a step-by-step debugging process - what this means is that the execution stops as soon as an error occurs, not allowing this to pass to the console. Though this is a great benefit, Python may not be able to challenge the developers in a way that will positively impact their skills due to Python being more intuitive than most other lanugages. Those that do use Python experience it being slower than other lanuages like C or C++ and experience testing to be complex and tedious with its Runtime errors.

Similar to JavaScript, Python has its deal of benefits and drawbacks, however it still has a 38% demand amongst recruiters through the top software development companies world wide.

## Q6
### A hypothetical client has sent you an email (shown in the Q6 Email section), asking for you to build them a website. Write an appropriate, professional email response that shows your understanding of the client’s needs for the website, as well as an understanding of appropriate technologies or tools needed to build the website yourself.	

## Hypothetical Client
Hello there

My name is Alex, and I’m the director of the Super Awesome Museum (SAM). We display a variety of interesting artefacts, objects, and paraphernalia about all sorts of things from all over the world.

I’m writing to you because the SAM needs a website. The museum is new in the city, we’re fully funded and don’t sell our items but we just need to encourage people to visit the museum.

We would need a website that showcases some of our interesting exhibits and items, helps people find their way to the museum, and helps people contact the museum.

We don’t know much about this website stuff - does this sound like something that you can do? 

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Alex

Director
